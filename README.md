Taiga contrib unrated
=====================

Taiga contrib unrated is a Taiga plugin that extends the Taiga software to fit our needs at Unrated Film Industries. At the moment, those modifications include:

* Each user is forced to login even on formerly public pages, reducing the risk of confidential information leaking out.
* Users can join public projects by themselves and get assigned to a configurable standard role.
